# bd2k-extras
quick **untested** py3 coversion of [s3am](https://github.com/BD2KGenomics/s3am) and [bd2k-python-lib](https://github.com/BD2KGenomics/bd2k-python-lib), originally by the [UCSC Genomics Institute - Computational Genomics Lab](https://github.com/BD2KGenomics)

should in theory allow access to s3 with [ProTECT](https://github.com/Dranion/protect) 

1. simply git clone then: 
2. in the *same virtual env* as ProTECT 
3. 'make develop' bd2k-python-lib
4. 'make develop' s3am 

should satisfy dependencies in theory
